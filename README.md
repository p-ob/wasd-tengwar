# wasd tengwar

A 61-key, Tengwar keyboard layout to be used at [wasd keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/).

## Instructions

Use [tengwar.svg](./tengwar.svg) to customize your keyboard layout.

If you want to customize the lettering, you'll need to edit [tengwar_editable.svg](./tengwar_editable.svg). Prior to uploading, however, you'll need to convert all non-standard characters (so all Tengwar) to path to be recognized by wasd keyboards.
